# Football Player and Ball Tracker

## Overview

Real-time player and ball tracking system using **YOLOv8** for object detection and **SORT** (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for multi-object tracking. This system maintains unique IDs for each player/ball across frames, enabling robust tracking even during occlusions.

## Features

✅ **Real-time Detection** - YOLOv8 detects players and ball in each frame  
✅ **Persistent Tracking** - SORT maintains unique IDs across frames  
✅ **ROI Masking** - Excludes scoreboard/crowd to focus on play area  
✅ **Occlusion Handling** - Tracks survive temporary occlusions  
✅ **ID Persistence** - Same player keeps same ID throughout video  
✅ **Comprehensive Visualization** - 2×2 grid showing all processing stages  

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- `opencv-python` - Video processing
- `numpy` - Array operations
- `ultralytics` - YOLOv8 model
- `filterpy` - Kalman filter for SORT
- `scipy` - Hungarian algorithm for SORT

### 2. Run the Tracker

```bash
python tracker.py
```

The first run will automatically download the YOLOv8n model (~6MB).

### 3. Controls

- **`q`**: Quit
- **`p`**: Pause/resume

## Understanding the Output

### 2×2 Display Grid

**Panel 1 (Top-Left): ROI Mask Visualization**
- Shows which areas are being analyzed
- Red overlay = excluded regions (scoreboard, crowd)
- Clear area = Region of Interest where detection runs

**Panel 2 (Top-Right): Masked Frame**
- What YOLO actually "sees"
- Top and bottom are blacked out
- Only the play area is visible

**Panel 3 (Bottom-Left): Tracked Objects**
- Original frame with tracking results
- Each player has a colored bounding box
- **Track ID displayed prominently** (e.g., "ID: 5")
- Center point marked for each track

**Panel 4 (Bottom-Right): Tracking Info**
- Current FPS
- Number of detections in current frame
- Number of active tracks

### Console Output

```
Frame 30/500 | Detections: 18 | Tracks: 15 | FPS: 12.3
```

- **Detections**: Raw YOLO detections (may include false positives)
- **Tracks**: Confirmed tracks after SORT filtering
- **FPS**: Processing speed

## Configuration

All parameters are in `tracker_config.py`. Key settings:

### ROI Masking

```python
ROI_TOP_PERCENT = 0.2     # Exclude top 20% (scoreboard)
ROI_BOTTOM_PERCENT = 0.2  # Exclude bottom 20% (ads/crowd)
```

### YOLO Detection

```python
YOLO_MODEL_PATH = "yolov8n.pt"  # Model size (n/s/m/l/x)
YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.5        # Confidence threshold
YOLO_TARGET_CLASSES = [0, 32]    # 0=person, 32=sports ball
```

### SORT Tracking

```python
SORT_MAX_AGE = 1           # Frames to keep track without detection
SORT_MIN_HITS = 3          # Min detections before track confirmed
SORT_IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.3   # Min IoU for matching
```

## How SORT Tracking Works

### The Problem

YOLO detects objects in each frame independently, but doesn't know:
- Which detection in frame 2 corresponds to which detection in frame 1
- How to handle temporary occlusions
- How to maintain consistent IDs

### The Solution: SORT

**1. Prediction (Kalman Filter)**
- Each track has a Kalman filter that predicts where it will be next frame
- Uses constant velocity model
- Handles temporary occlusions by continuing prediction

**2. Association (Hungarian Algorithm)**
- Computes IoU (Intersection over Union) between predictions and detections
- Solves optimal assignment problem
- Matches detections to existing tracks

**3. Track Management**
- **New tracks**: Created for unmatched detections
- **Updated tracks**: Matched detections update Kalman filter
- **Dead tracks**: Removed after `max_age` frames without match

**4. ID Assignment**
- Each track gets a unique, persistent ID
- ID maintained as long as track is active
- Same player = same ID throughout video

### SORT Parameters Explained

**`max_age`**: How many frames to keep track alive without detections
- **Low (1-2)**: Tracks die quickly → less clutter, but loses tracks in occlusions
- **High (5-10)**: Tracks survive longer → handles occlusions better, but more ghost tracks

**`min_hits`**: How many detections needed before track is confirmed
- **Low (1-2)**: Fast track establishment → quick IDs, but more false positives
- **High (3-5)**: Conservative → fewer false tracks, but slower to establish

**`iou_threshold`**: Minimum overlap for matching
- **Low (0.2)**: Lenient matching → maintains tracks better, but more ID switches
- **High (0.4)**: Strict matching → fewer ID switches, but may lose tracks

## Tuning Guide

### Problem: Missing Players

**Symptoms:**
- Players visible but not detected
- Low detection count

**Solutions:**
1. Lower confidence threshold:
   ```python
   YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # From 0.5
   ```

2. Use larger YOLO model:
   ```python
   YOLO_MODEL_PATH = "yolov8s.pt"  # or yolov8m.pt
   ```

3. Adjust ROI:
   ```python
   ROI_TOP_PERCENT = 0.15  # Include more area
   ROI_BOTTOM_PERCENT = 0.05
   ```

### Problem: Frequent ID Switches

**Symptoms:**
- Player's ID changes frame-to-frame
- Same person gets multiple IDs

**Solutions:**
1. Increase track survival:
   ```python
   SORT_MAX_AGE = 5  # From 1
   ```

2. More lenient matching:
   ```python
   SORT_IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.2  # From 0.3
   ```

3. Faster track confirmation:
   ```python
   SORT_MIN_HITS = 2  # From 3
   ```

### Problem: Tracks Lost During Occlusions

**Symptoms:**
- Player disappears briefly, gets new ID when reappearing
- Pileups cause track loss

**Solutions:**
1. Increase max age significantly:
   ```python
   SORT_MAX_AGE = 10  # Keep tracks alive longer
   ```

2. Lower IoU threshold:
   ```python
   SORT_IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.2  # More forgiving matches
   ```

### Problem: Too Many False Tracks

**Symptoms:**
- Ghost tracks on empty field
- Crowd members getting IDs
- High track count

**Solutions:**
1. Raise confidence threshold:
   ```python
   YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # From 0.5
   ```

2. Stricter track confirmation:
   ```python
   SORT_MIN_HITS = 5  # From 3
   ```

3. Adjust ROI to exclude more:
   ```python
   ROI_TOP_PERCENT = 0.25
   ROI_BOTTOM_PERCENT = 0.15
   ```

### Problem: Slow Processing

**Symptoms:**
- Low FPS (< 5)
- Laggy video playback

**Solutions:**
1. Use smallest YOLO model:
   ```python
   YOLO_MODEL_PATH = "yolov8n.pt"
   ```

2. Process every other frame:
   ```python
   FRAME_SKIP = 2
   ```

3. Use GPU if available:
   ```python
   YOLO_DEVICE = 'cuda'
   ```

4. Reduce image size:
   ```python
   YOLO_IMG_SIZE = 416  # From 640
   ```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Hardware | Model | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| CPU (i7) | yolov8n | 8-12 | Real-time capable |
| CPU (i7) | yolov8s | 4-6 | Acceptable |
| CPU (i7) | yolov8m | 2-3 | Slow |
| GPU (RTX 3060) | yolov8n | 30+ | Excellent |
| GPU (RTX 3060) | yolov8m | 20-25 | Very good |

## Advanced Usage

### Tracking Specific Players

To track only a subset of players, you can modify the detection filtering:

```python
# In tracker.py, add player number detection/filtering logic
# This would require OCR or custom training
```

### Exporting Track Data

To save tracking data for analysis:

```python
# Add to main loop in tracker.py:
track_data = {
    'frame': frame_count,
    'tracks': tracks.tolist()
}
# Save to JSON or CSV
```

### Custom Visualization

Modify `draw_tracks()` function to add:
- Trail/trajectory lines
- Speed vectors
- Heatmaps
- Team colors (requires team classification)

## Troubleshooting

### YOLOv8 Model Not Found

First run downloads the model automatically. If it fails:

```bash
# Download manually
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=yolov8n.pt source=test.jpg
```

### ImportError: No module named 'ultralytics'

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

### SORT Not Tracking Well

SORT works best when:
- ✅ Detections are consistent (tune YOLO confidence)
- ✅ Camera is relatively stable (not rapid zooming/panning)
- ✅ Players don't overlap heavily (adjust max_age for occlusions)

## Comparison: Old vs New System

| Feature | Old (Field Line Detection) | New (YOLO + SORT) |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Detect field lines | Track players/ball |
| **Method** | HSV masking + Hough | YOLO + Kalman filter |
| **Output** | Line coordinates | Player IDs + positions |
| **Accuracy** | Dependent on field color | Robust to field conditions |
| **Speed** | Fast (~25 FPS) | Moderate (~10 FPS) |
| **Use Case** | Homography/top-down view | Player tracking/analytics |

## Next Steps

With robust player tracking now working:

1. **Export Trajectories** - Save track positions for analysis
2. **Team Classification** - Classify players by team (jersey color/number)
3. **Ball Possession** - Determine which player has the ball
4. **Event Detection** - Detect tackles, passes, runs
5. **Statistics** - Distance covered, speed, formation analysis

## FAQ

**Q: Why is detection slow?**  
A: YOLO is computationally expensive. Use yolov8n (fastest) or enable GPU.

**Q: Can I track the ball separately?**  
A: Yes! Class ID 32 is sports ball. Filter tracks by size (ball is much smaller).

**Q: How do I track specific jersey numbers?**  
A: Requires additional OCR/recognition. Can be added as post-processing.

**Q: Why do IDs switch sometimes?**  
A: Heavy occlusions or fast movement. Increase SORT_MAX_AGE and lower IOU_THRESHOLD.

**Q: Can I use a custom YOLO model?**  
A: Yes! Train on your specific footage for better accuracy. Update YOLO_MODEL_PATH.
