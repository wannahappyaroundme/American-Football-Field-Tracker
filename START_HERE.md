# üèà START HERE - Football Tracker System

## What This Is

A **complete player and ball tracking system** for American football footage using:
- **YOLOv8** for detecting players and ball
- **SORT algorithm** for maintaining unique player IDs across frames
- **ROI masking** to focus only on the play area

## Installation (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Verify installation
python verify_installation.py

# 3. Run tracker
python tracker.py
```

That's it! üéâ

## What You'll See

A 2√ó2 grid showing:
1. ROI mask (what's being analyzed)
2. Masked frame (YOLO input)
3. **Tracked players with IDs** ‚≠ê (main output)
4. Stats (FPS, detection count)

**Panel 3** shows each player with a **unique Track ID** (e.g., "ID: 5") that persists across frames.

## Configuration

Edit `tracker_config.py` to change:

```python
# Your video
VIDEO_INPUT_PATH = "your_video.mp4"
VIDEO_OUTPUT_PATH = "tracked_output.mp4"

# Detection sensitivity (lower = more detections)
YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.5

# ROI coverage (adjust if field not covered)
ROI_TOP_PERCENT = 0.2     # Exclude top 20%
ROI_BOTTOM_PERCENT = 0.1  # Exclude bottom 10%

# Tracking persistence (higher = survives occlusions better)
SORT_MAX_AGE = 1
```

## Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **No players detected** | `YOLO_CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.3` |
| **IDs keep switching** | `SORT_MAX_AGE = 5` |
| **Too slow** | Already using fastest model |
| **ROI wrong** | Adjust `ROI_TOP_PERCENT` and `ROI_BOTTOM_PERCENT` |

## Controls

- **`q`** - Quit
- **`p`** - Pause/resume

## Project Structure

### ‚úÖ USE THESE (New Tracking System)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`tracker.py`** | Main script - RUN THIS |
| `sort.py` | SORT algorithm |
| `tracker_config.py` | Configuration |
| `verify_installation.py` | Check installation |

### üìö Documentation

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| **`QUICKSTART.md`** | Fast start guide |
| `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` | Complete overview |
| `TRACKER_README.md` | Full documentation |

### üì¶ Old System (Reference Only)

The old field line detection system is kept for reference:
- `football_field_tracker.py`
- `config.py`
- `test_line_detection.py`
- Related markdown files

**You don't need these** - use `tracker.py` instead!

## Expected Performance

| Hardware | FPS | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Laptop (i5) | 5-7 | Acceptable |
| Desktop (i7) | 8-12 | Good |
| GPU (RTX 3060) | 30+ | Excellent |

## Success Criteria

You're ready when:
- ‚úÖ Players have bounding boxes
- ‚úÖ Each has a visible Track ID
- ‚úÖ IDs stay consistent for 30-60 frames
- ‚úÖ FPS is acceptable (>5)

## What's Next?

Once tracking works:
1. **Export data** - Save track positions to JSON/CSV
2. **Team classification** - Identify teams by jersey color
3. **Ball possession** - Determine which player has ball
4. **Statistics** - Distance, speed, heatmaps
5. **Event detection** - Tackles, passes, runs

## Why This Approach?

**Old system**: Detected field lines (for homography)  
**Problem**: HSV masking incorrectly removed players

**New system**: Detects and tracks players directly  
**Solution**: YOLOv8 + SORT = robust player tracking with persistent IDs

This is what you need for player/ball analytics! ‚úÖ
