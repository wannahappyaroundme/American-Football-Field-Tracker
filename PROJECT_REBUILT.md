## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install (30 seconds)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Team Colors (2 minutes)

Edit `tracker.py` (lines 30-38):

```python
# Adjust these to match your teams:
TEAM_A_HSV_RANGE = ((90, 50, 50), (130, 255, 255))    # Blue
TEAM_B_HSV_RANGE = ((0, 0, 180), (180, 30, 255))      # White
REFEREE_HSV_RANGE = ((0, 0, 0), (180, 255, 60))       # Black
```

### 3. Run Analysis

```bash
python tracker.py
```

**Input**: `input_game.mp4` (or configure `INPUT_VIDEO`)  
**Output**: `output_analysis.mp4`  
**Time**: ~1-2 minutes for typical game clip  

### 4. Review Output

Open `output_analysis.mp4`:
- **Left**: Original with team-colored boxes
- **Right**: Tactical top-down view

## 📊 System Architecture

```
Input Video (MP4)
    ↓
[Frame 1] → Field Line Detection → Homography Matrix (static)
    ↓
[All Frames] → YOLOv8 Detection → Bounding Boxes
    ↓
[Each Player] → Color Extraction → K-Means → Team Classification
    ↓
[Positions] → Homography Transform → Top-Down Coordinates
    ↓
[Visualization] → Annotate Original + Draw Tactical Map
    ↓
[Output] → Side-by-Side MP4 Video
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Video Paths

```python
# Line 22-23 in tracker.py
INPUT_VIDEO = "your_video.mp4"
OUTPUT_VIDEO = "your_output.mp4"
```

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

```python
# Line 26
YOLO_CONFIDENCE = 0.3  # Lower = more detections
```

### Modify Field Dimensions

```python
# Lines 41-44
FIELD_WIDTH = 600      # Wider tactical map
FIELD_HEIGHT = 900     # Taller tactical map
```

### Change Team Colors

```python
# Lines 34-36 (BGR format)
TEAM_A_COLOR = (255, 0, 0)      # Blue boxes
TEAM_B_COLOR = (0, 255, 0)      # Green boxes
REFEREE_COLOR = (0, 255, 255)   # Yellow boxes
```

## ⚡ Performance

**Processing Speed**:
- CPU: 8-15 FPS
- GPU: 25-35 FPS

**This is intentionally slow** - accuracy over speed!

**For 1088 frames**:
- CPU: ~70-135 seconds
- GPU: ~30-45 seconds

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (In README.md)

The README.md lists 10+ potential improvements:
- Player tracking (SORT/DeepSORT)
- Ball detection and possession
- Custom model training
- Dynamic homography
- Pose estimation
- Advanced analytics
- Event detection
- Real-time processing
